# Chatbot-in-tensorflow

# Introduction:-
The chatbot is an A.I. powered software. A chatbot is often described as one of the most advanced and promising expressions of interaction between humans and machines. However, from a technological point of view, a chatbot only represents the natural evolution of a Question-Answering system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models ([Sutskever et al.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf), [2014, Cho et al., 2014](http://emnlp2014.org/papers/pdf/EMNLP2014179.pdf)) have enjoyed great success in a variety of tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and text summarization. This chatbot is based on seq2seq neural network with an attention mechanism. The LSTM(Long short term memory) cell is being used in the seq2seq NN. For the word embedding, Glove pretrained model is being used.
